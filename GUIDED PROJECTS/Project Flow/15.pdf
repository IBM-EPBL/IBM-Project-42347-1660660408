Step 1: Preprocessing the signal
Step 2: Generation of spectrograms (2-D Images) using STFT
Step 3: Augmentation of data
Step 4: Feature Extraction using CNN
Step 5: The classification of Arrhythmia based on extracted features

HOW WE ARE DOING IT
====================

Step 1: Code in the local machine in the Jupiter notebook using the anaconda navigator.
Step 2: Saving the model in the IBM Watson studio.
